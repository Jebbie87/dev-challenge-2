#Dev Challenge #2

## How to start

`npm install` in terminal and wait for it......

`npm start` after all the dependencies finish installing.

You will have to include your own openweathermap API key inside a .env file. There is an .env.example file included and you just have to replace the `YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY_FROM_OPENWEATHERMAP_HERE` with your own API key.

After that, open a browser and go to either `localhost:3000` or `0.0.0.0:3000`.

I will be refactoring this into Koa 2/ES2017
